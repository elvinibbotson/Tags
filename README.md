# Tags
<i>visual indexing of websites</i><br><br>
An alternative to the usual bookmarks with their hierarchical folders, Tags lets you label pages with tags by choosing icons.
You can tag a page with one, two or several tags.<br><br>
Instead of placing a bookmark in a particular place within your bookmarks folders, you can find it using any of the tags you tagged it with.
A clothing retailer's site, for example, might be tagged with both the 'fashion' and the 'shopping' tags. Searching with either tag will include the page in the results,
while searching with both tags will just list sites with both tags.<br><br>
Tags is a browser extension and can be used with desktop/laptop/Chromebook browsers or on a phone or tablet using a browser such as Kiwi which accepts extensions.
Pinning Tags in your browser lets you tag a page in a couple of clicks.<br><br>
The mechanism involves creating bookmarks in a dedicated Tags bookmarks folder, adding tags|$tags to the bookmark titles.
Download the <a href='Tags.crx'>extension</a> and add it to yoour browser's extensions.
